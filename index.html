                                The system which is still in its early stage requires a lot of information
                                and education of the public to enable them appreciate the laudable
                                programme put together by government to protect their interests. If they
                                are properly and adequately educated, the chances of total acceptable of
                                the programme can be assured. The banks also need to be carried along in
                                the implementation process as they play a crucial role.
                                Furthermore, many see e-payment as an imposition.
                                Also, The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has named weak risk
                                management framework and security issues among the major challenges
                                affecting electronic payment system in the country.
                                The CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, made the disclosure as a
                                keynote presenter at the 8th Annual Conference of the Chartered Institute
                                of Bankers of Nigeria in Abuja on Tuesday. The theme of the conference 
                                was “Positioning Nigeria’s Payments System for Global
                                competitiveness”. “While CBN efforts have gone into transformation of
                                the payments system in line with global trends, we should not lose sight
                                of the associated risks and challenges. These challenges include, but not
                                limited to weak risk management framework, security issues, resistance
                                of target customers to patronize and embrace new products”, Emefiele
                                said. He said another challenge was the “lack of unique identifier for
                                customers across institutions and high operation cost”. According to him,

                                bank’s working hours are advised to return the next day. This process
                                has always resulted in students missing their lectures, tests and/or
                                examinations while they are queuing to make payments in banks. It has
                                also resulted to too much costs and a lot of time used in transferring and
                                withdrawing money whenever sponsors of students make money transfers
                                to students who can pay its fees at specific bank branches. The process
                                requires sponsors of students from wherever they are to send money to
                                students through either banks, mobile money or any other possible way(s)
                                so that students can pay the polytechnic fees. This consumes time and
                                sponsors incur extra costs in this process of sending money to students.
                                Now, the method of paying school fess is quite tasking and time
                                consuming. First, one has to generate invoice before making cash deposit
                                at designated bank branches. The invoice generation for school fees
                                payment is a fine development however, it has require students visiting
                                the School Portal to rectify issues associated with invoice generation.
                                Sometimes the complete details of the invoice generated do not appear
                                after generation. It was upon this background that the researcher
                                suggested an alternative method which enables secure online fees
                                payment by students and/or their sponsors. This payment method will
